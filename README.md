# Normal-Reconstruction-Godot
In desire for pixel-art in Godot on HTML5 was moved I to normal reconstruction for normal buffer lacking

## Ok but seriously it was one hell of a task
Anyways the ideas and code samples were taken from these amasing resources:
- [Different normal reconstruction methods](https://gist.github.com/bgolus/a07ed65602c009d5e2f753826e8078a0)
- [Original post for best method](https://atyuwen.github.io/posts/normal-reconstruction/)
- [Reason why i started this](https://www.youtube.com/@t3ssel8r)
- [T3ssel8r's shader in Godot](https://godotshaders.com/shader/3d-pixel-art-outline-highlight-post-processing-shader/)
- [Smooth upscaling for pixelart](https://godotshaders.com/shader/sub-pixel-accurate-pixel-sprite-filtering/)
These were great help in my journey.
